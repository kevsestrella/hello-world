# hello-world

Hello Everyone!

Kevin here, just want to say I'm starting my github life now. I hope I'm not too late. I've read somewhere that it's good to spend time on Project Euler, and to place whatever I do there in here, that is, without violating their rules. Hope this goes well. I'd appreciate all the help that I will get here.

That's it for now.

I've just find out that I have already started my github life before, that is, have repos after signing up. I have the Learn Git and LCTHW repos. This is kind of sad...means I have forgetten how to use this thing. The thing is, I tried to learn this in the past so that apart from learning it, I could place it on my CV. Since learning it, I wasn't able to use it anymore. I guess I need to start do some personal projects to practice Git. 

That's it for now #2.
