# hello-world

Hello Everyone!

Kevin here, just want to say I'm starting my github life now. I hope I'm not too late. I've read somewhere that it's good to spend time on Project Euler, and to place whatever I do there in here, that is, without violating their rules. Hope this goes well. I'd appreciate all the help that I will get here.

That's it for now.
